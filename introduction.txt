Hi, my name is Ian Sabia.
I am a student at Boston University.
My favorite class so far at BU has been DS121, as I liked learning about linear algebra. I am also taking DS340 (Intro to AI/ML) which has been very interesting and of course DS219!
A fun fact about me: I enjoy working on data science projects in my free time.
